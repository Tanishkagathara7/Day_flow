## 🔐 Authentication & Role Management

### Admin (System-Level Authority)
- Admin credentials are **pre-defined and stored directly in the database**
- Admin account **cannot be self-registered or generated by the system**
- Ensures maximum security and prevents unauthorized privilege escalation

### Admin Capabilities
- Create and manage **Employee / HR accounts**
- Assign, reset, and update passwords
- Activate / deactivate user accounts
- View complete work history of every employee
- Full control over payroll, attendance, and leave data

## 👥 Employee / HR Functionalities

### Attendance Management
- Employees must perform **Time-In** when entering the office
- Employees must perform **Time-Out** when leaving
- System automatically records:
  - Date
  - Entry time
  - Exit time
  - Total working duration

### Payroll Calculation
- Salary is calculated **based on actual working hours**
- Late arrivals, early exits, or absences impact salary deductions
- Payroll data is automatically generated using attendance records
- Ensures **accurate and transparent salary computation**

### Leave Management
- Employees can apply for leave requests
- Leave requests go through **admin approval workflow**
- Leave history is permanently stored and reflected in payroll

## 📊 Admin Dashboard & Work History

The Admin panel provides:

- Complete employee profiles
- Attendance history (daily, weekly, monthly)
- Leave request history and approvals
- Payroll records and salary calculations
- Full employee work lifecycle tracking

This ensures **end-to-end visibility** and **centralized workforce management**.
